  - **Apply Discounts**: Easily apply both percentage-based and fixed amount coupons to your cart with straightforward method calls.
    
    ```php
    use RealRashid\Cart\Facades\Cart;
    use App\Coupons\PercentageCoupon;
    
    // Create and apply a percentage-based coupon
    $percentageCoupon = new PercentageCoupon('PERCENT20', 20, '2024-12-31');

    namespace App\Coupons;
    
    use RealRashid\Cart\Coupon\Coupon as CouponContract;
    use App\Models\Coupon as CouponModel;
    
    class FixedAmountCoupon implements CouponContract
    {
        protected $coupon;
    
        public function __construct(CouponModel $coupon)
        {
            $this->coupon = $coupon;
        }
    
        public function getCode(): string
        {
            return $this->coupon->code;
        }
    
        public function isValid(): bool
        {
            return $this->coupon->isValid();
        }
    
        public function getDiscountType(): string
        {
            return 'fixed_amount';
        }
    
        public function getExpiryDate(): string
        {
            return $this->coupon->expiry_date;
        }
    
        public function getDiscountAmount(): float
        {
            return $this->coupon->amount;
        }
    }
    
    ```

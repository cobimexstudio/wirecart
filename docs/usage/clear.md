# Clearing the Cart

To clear the entire cart, effectively emptying it, you can use either `Cart::clear()` or `cart()->clear()`.

## Method Signatures

```php
Cart::clear();
```

or

```php
cart()->clear();
```

## Example

Using `Cart::clear()`:

```php
use RealRashid\Cart\Facades\Cart;

// Simulate clearing the cart
Cart::clear();
```
Using `cart()->clear()`:

```php
// Simulate clearing the cart
cart()->clear();
```

In both examples, the entire contents of the cart will be removed.


That's it! You're now equipped to clear your shopping cart using the Cart package.

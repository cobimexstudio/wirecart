# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

Please read and understand the contribution guide before creating an issue or pull request.

## Etiquette

This project is open source, and as such, I dedicate my free time to build and maintain the source code. It is made available in the hope that it will be useful to other developers. It would be unfair to suffer abuse or anger for my hard work.

Please be considerate when raising issues or presenting pull requests. Let's show that developers are respectful and collaborative.

It is my duty to ensure that all submissions are of sufficient quality to benefit the project. Respect my decisions, and please do not be upset if your submission is not used.

## Viability

Before requesting or submitting new features, consider whether it will be useful to others. Open source projects are used by many developers with different needs. Think about whether your feature might be beneficial to other users of the project.

## Procedure

Before filing an issue:

- Attempt to replicate the problem to ensure it wasn't a coincidental incident.
- Check if your feature suggestion is already present in the project.
- Look through the pull requests tab to ensure the bug doesn’t already have a fix in progress.
- Check the pull requests tab to see if the feature is already being worked on.

Before submitting a pull request:

- Verify that your feature doesn’t already exist in the codebase.
- Check the pull requests to ensure that someone else hasn’t already submitted the feature or fix.

## Requirements

If there are additional requirements for the project, you will find them listed here:

- **[PSR-2 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)**: Install [PHP Code Sniffer](https://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer) to apply the conventions easily.

- **Add tests**: Your patch won’t be accepted if it doesn’t include tests.

- **Document changes**: Update the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation to reflect changes in behavior.

- **Respect our release cycle**: Follow [SemVer v2.0.0](https://semver.org/) and avoid randomly breaking public APIs.

- **One pull request per feature**: If you want to implement multiple features, please submit separate pull requests for each.

- **Send coherent history**: Ensure each commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you made multiple intermediate commits, please [squash them](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submission.

**Happy coding**!
